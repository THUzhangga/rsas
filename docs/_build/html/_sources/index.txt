Documentation of the rsas library
=================================

This library allows you to model transport through arbitrary control volumes using
rank StorAge Selection (rSAS) functions.


Getting started
===============

Before you install
******************

rsas depends on the Python libraries numpy, scipy, and cython, and the example
codes use pandas to wrangle the timeseries data. These must all be installed.
The Anaconda package (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) contains all
the needed pieces, and is an easy way to get started. Install it before you
install rsas.

Installation
************

The main part of the code is written in Cython to allow fast execution. Before
you use rsas you must comile and install it. Open a terminal in the rsas directory
and run:

> python setup.py install

It may take a few minutes. You may get warning messages, all of which can be ignored.
Error messages cannot though, and will prevent the compilation from completion.

Once the code has compiled successfully you don't need to do it again
unless this code is changed.

Examples
********

Example uses of rsas are available:

examples/lower_hafren.py
------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/lower_hafren.py

examples/simple_timestepping.py
-------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/simple_timestepping.py
